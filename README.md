3DM
===

A simple 3D mathematic library, only a handful of matrices and vectors functions right now.


Intention
---------

There're many great C++ libraries for OpenGL mathematics, but I need a lightweight solution for C. To write this library, I've had the chance to review my linear algebra knowledge.


Status
------

This very first version is developed upon GCC vector extensions, it's intented to be fast but not optimized yet.


LICENSE
-------

BSD 3-clause.
